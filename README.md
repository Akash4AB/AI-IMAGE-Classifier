# AI IMAGE CLASSIFIER

The primary goal of this project is to create an image classification model that can accurately identify whether an image is Real or generated by AI. This involves training a neural network on a diverse dataset of both Real and AI-generated images, allowing the model to learn subtle differences and characteristics unique to each type.To accomplish this, `selenium` was used, with which images from Google were downloaded. Apart from scraped Google Images, one more dataset from Kaggle was used.
- CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images

## Installation

Open Git Bash and change the directory to the location where the repository is to be cloned. Then, type the following commands.
```shell
  git init
```
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Sachin8871/AI-IMAGE-Classifier.git
```
```shell
  git cd AI-IMAGE-Classifier
```
Now, install the requirements using the following command.

```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To access or use the application, open a terminal in the cloned repository folder and run the following command.

```shell
  streamlit run app.py
```
Finally, browse the link provided in your browser.

Note: While running the uploaded image on the streamlit webpage if you face `UnicodeEncodeError` then go to the Git Bash and rerun the below code:

```shell
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
```
```shell
  streamlit run app.py
```

## Data Sources
The dataset comprised of Real and AI Generated Images. Scraped Images were collected from Google using 'selenium'.
- Scraped Images by us ( [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KpvGeyJsPLMFlVqu-kGOt0ygZtvacNm8/view?usp=drive_linkv) )
- CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images ( [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images) )

We merge the datasets by first converting them into a zip file, and then merging them using Python.
- Python file for merging:  ( [Link](https://github.com/Sachin8871/AI-IMAGE-Classifier/blob/7133d7f792e3702f8da9f8d6a506b1c90b18d902/AI_IMAGE/Merging_datasets.ipynb) )

- Final dataset Used for training ( [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kQvbB4fc9AEVFx2KbCdwMyAaBMXHSpFd/view?usp=drivesdk) )

Combing the three datasets, we have:

- Train Set: 102109
- Test Set: 20889

## Model
Taking inspiration from principles found in popular models like `VGG`, `ResNet`, and `DenseNet`, we design this architecture with six convolution layers, three pooling layers, and four fully connected layers including output layer. We also use Batch Normalization and Dropout layers. In all the layers, we use the `selu` activation function. The model is structured to handle 64x64 RGB images and output classification prediction with probability.

> The model architecture and model summary are uploaded.
